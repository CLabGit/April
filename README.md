# April: Accuracy-Improved Floating-Point Approximation For Neural Network Accelerators (DAC'25)

## Directory Descriptions

This repository contains two main directories that organize the project's evaluation data and scripts:

### 1. `accuracy_evaluation/`
This directory contains all files and scripts related to the evaluation of the accuracy of the system. It may include:
- Datasets used for accuracy testing.
- Scripts for running accuracy-related tests.
- Results and logs from accuracy evaluation experiments.

### 2. `hardware_evaluation/`
This directory is dedicated to the evaluation of hardware performance. It may include:
- Benchmarking tools or scripts for assessing hardware performance.
- Logs and results from hardware evaluation.
- Configuration files or test parameters specific to hardware experiments.

## Usage
- Navigate to `accuracy_evaluation` for all accuracy-related tests and results.
- Navigate to `hardware_evaluation` for hardware performance tests and benchmarks.
